We have 2 players AIs called "navis". Their names are Rock and Bass.
Normally we start with a 4n*4n grid with every cell empty and elementless(grey element). For this example, we'll be playing with a 2n*2n grid.

Both players start with 256 energy.

A map is made up of squares. Each square can be given an element. A navi can only teleport to a square of the same color as its body.
Map squares are the only object in the game that can have the grey element.

Navis do not start with any knowledge.

A navi has:
    - Energy
        - Energy is used for executing any action, improving the weight of an action, and improving the strength of an action (where appropriate) 
    - A deck of Battle Chips (Spells)
    - An Element they deal extra damage to
    - An Element they take extra damage from
    - An Element their body is made of

A navi has the following action options:
    - Do nothing
    - Acquire board state
    - Teleport to a space of the same element as their body
    - Change the element of any space on the grid
    - Use a battle chip. Battle chips explained later.
    - Refresh a battle chip

Battle chips are the only method of attack in the game
    - They have a pattern and an element
    - When a battle chip is used, the pattern is drawn around the navi
    - Any opponent that is in the pattern takes appropriate damage
    - After a battle chip is used it cannot be used again, unless it is refreshed


The game cycle is
while True:
	1. Decide actions (Each navi gets 1)
	2. Weigh actions
	3. Execute actions

Turn 0.

1. Rock(B/R/G): 256
2. Bass(Y/B/R): 256

Rock is Blue. He is strong against Red. He is weak against Green.
Bass is Yellow. He is strong against Blue. He is weak against Red.

Neither player knows what the board state is. They have a few microseconds to decide an action and inform the game of their action. If they do not send one in a timely manner, they will stay where they are and do nothing, forfeiting their turn.

A player can weigh their action and change its priority by spending energy on their action. They can also increase its strength, if appropriate.

Turn 1.
Neither player has the board state, so they acquire it.
Turn 1 is complete.

Turn 2.
    #Decide actions
        Rock decides to make the square next to Bass blue so that he can teleport to it.
        Bass decides to make a center square yellow so that he can teleport to it.
        Neither boost the speed of these actions. Color changing costs 4 energy.
    #Weight actions
        Both weights are the same.
        The actions happen in order.
    #Execute actions
        4,3 is blue
        2,2 is yellow
